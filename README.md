# TuCampus

TuCampus is a university marketplace platform designed to connect students inside campus and make buying and selling easier.

The project was created to solve a common problem observed in university environments: students who sell food, desserts, study materials or small services often spend hours physically searching for customers around campus.

TuCampus centralizes these offers in a digital catalog where students can publish products and other students can discover and contact sellers directly.

## Problem Solved

Many university students generate income by selling products inside campus.

Common challenges:

- Sellers lose time walking around faculties searching for buyers
- Buyers often do not know who is selling products nearby
- There is no centralized marketplace focused exclusively on university students

TuCampus was built to reduce this friction.

## Product Thinking Decisions

During development several UX decisions were made:

- Replaced image URL input with direct gallery upload because mobile users found URLs inconvenient
- Forced phone number registration before allowing product publication
- Redirected users directly to profile setup when required information was missing
- Limited simultaneous publications to reduce backend abuse
- Optimized search architecture to avoid downloading full catalog unnecessarily

The focus was not only building functionality but improving usability for real student users.
